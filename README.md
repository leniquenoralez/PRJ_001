# PROJECT 001

The command library function passes a command to the shell and return stdout and stderr 

### SYNOPSIS
    #include <command.h>
    int command(const char *cmd , char ∗outbuf , int outlen , char ∗errbuf , int errlen);
### DESCRIPTION
    The command function passes the argument cmd to the command interpreter sh. Any output 
    generated by the command on stdout is placed into the buffer outbuf; any output generated 
    on stderr is placed into the buffer errbuf. command will only write up to outlen and 
    errlen bytes to the respective buffers.
    
    If the number of bytes written into each buffer is less than the provided length, then 
    command will NULL terminate the data it wrote; otherwise, the buffer is not terminated. 
    The calling process waits for the shell to finish executing the command, ignoring SIGINT 
    and SIGQUIT, and blocking SIGCHLD.
    
    If string is a NULL pointer, command() will return non-zero, if the command interpreter 
    is available, or zero if none is available. Otherwise, command() returns the termination 
    status of the shell in the format specified by waitpid(2).

### RETURN VALUES
    If a child process cannot be created, or the termination status of the shell cannot be 
    obtained, command() returns -1 and sets errno to indicate the error. If execution of 
    the shell fails, command() returns the termination status for a program that terminates 
    with a call of exit(127)
